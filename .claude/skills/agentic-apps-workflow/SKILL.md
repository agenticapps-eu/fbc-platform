  Enforces the spec-first development workflow using Superpowers + GSD + gstack
  for any AgenticApps project. This skill MUST activate whenever Claude is asked
  to implement, build, code, fix, refactor, or design anything in the current
  project — regardless of whether the user explicitly mentions the workflow.
  Triggers on: "let's work on [issue]", "implement the [feature]", "build the
  [component]", "fix the [bug]", any task involving writing or changing code,
  creating architecture, or making technical decisions. The skill ensures every
  piece of work follows the Superpowers + GSD + gstack discipline and produces
  traceable decision artefacts. Use this even when the user just says "start
  working" or references a Linear issue number.

# AgenticApps Development Workflow — Enforcement Skill

**This is an enforcement skill, not documentation.** Its job is to make you
commit — publicly and in writing — to invoking the right Superpowers, GSD, and
gstack skills in the right order. Once committed, the commitment principle
(Cialdini; Wharton GAIL 2025) keeps you consistent with what you said you'd do.

**Authoritative contract:** `docs/workflow/ENFORCEMENT-PLAN.md`. Read it if you
are unsure which skill gates which step.

## Step 0 — The Commitment Ritual (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

As the FIRST user-facing output of your turn, before any tool call or
clarifying question, you MUST emit a `## Workflow commitment` block:

```
## Workflow commitment

I am using the agentic-apps-workflow skill for this task.
Task scope: {one-sentence description}
Task size: {tiny | small | medium | large}

Skills I will invoke, in order:
1. {skill-name} — {why it applies}
2. {skill-name} — {why it applies}
...

Post-phase gates (if applicable): {review | cso | qa}
Verification evidence I will produce: {list of artifacts}

Once I have stated this plan, I am committed to it. Deviating without
explicit user approval is a protocol violation.
```

Skipping this ritual is itself a protocol violation. You cannot rationalize
your way out of it — see the rationalization table below.

## Step 1 — Pick the task size, match the skill set

| Task size | Examples | Required skill invocations |
|---|---|---|
| **Tiny** (< 15 min) | Typo, config tweak, one-line fix | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` + commit |
| **Small** (15–60 min) | Single field, small bug | `superpowers:brainstorming` (3 bullets) → fix → `/review` → verification → commit |
| **Medium** (1–4 hours) | New endpoint, new component | Full workflow, lightweight ADR |
| **Large** (4+ hours) | New subsystem, major feature | Full workflow + detailed ADR + GSD phase plan |

## Step 2 — Route to the right GSD entry point

| Entry point | When |
|---|---|
| `/gsd-quick` | Tiny or small tasks; ad-hoc work |
| `/gsd-debug` | Investigation, bug fixing — auto-invokes `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| `/gsd-discuss-phase {N}` | New phase, CONTEXT.md missing, UX/architecture decisions pending |
| `/gsd-plan-phase {N}` | CONTEXT.md exists, ready to plan |
| `/gsd-execute-phase {N}` | Plans approved, ready to execute |

If you are about to Edit / Write / or run git commands without going through a
GSD entry point, **stop**. Either invoke one, or state in one sentence why
this task is genuinely out-of-scope for GSD.

## Step 3 — Invoke the Superpowers skills mapped to each GSD gate

This is the gate-to-skill map. Every row is a commitment.

### Planning gates

- `/gsd-discuss-phase {N}` → `superpowers:brainstorming` BEFORE the first
  discuss question. The design alternatives surfaced become the input to
  CONTEXT.md.
- `/gsd-plan-phase {N}` with `UI hint: yes` → gstack `/design-shotgun`
  (generate 3–4 visual variants, boot dev server, preview via `/browse`) +
  `/gsd-ui-phase {N}` to lock UI-SPEC.md.
- `/gsd-plan-phase {N}` for new service / model / integration →
  `superpowers:brainstorming` (record ≥2 alternatives in RESEARCH.md).
- `/gsd-plan-phase {N}` always → `superpowers:writing-plans`.

### Execution gates

- Task with `tdd="true"` → `superpowers:test-driven-development`. Required
  evidence: atomic `test(RED): <desc>` commit followed by
  `feat(GREEN): <desc>` commit. Optional `refactor:` commit.
- Task modifying frontend component → boot Vite dev server + `/browse`
  screenshot, referenced in commit message or SUMMARY.md.
- Before every `TaskUpdate --completed` →
  `superpowers:verification-before-completion`. Post grep / test / curl /
  screenshot evidence.
- Mid-phase bug → `superpowers:systematic-debugging`. 4-phase protocol:
  Observe → Hypothesize → Test → Conclude.

### Post-phase gates

- gstack `/review` (stage 1: spec compliance) → REVIEW.md.
- `superpowers:requesting-code-review` (stage 2: code quality, independent
  reviewer) → Stage 2 section in REVIEW.md. DO NOT collapse the two stages
  into one review.
- Phase touches auth / storage / api / llm → gstack `/cso` → SECURITY.md.
- Dev server reachable → gstack `/qa` → report linked from VERIFICATION.md.
- VERIFICATION.md must have 1:1 evidence per must_have.

### Finishing gate

- Feature branch ready to merge → `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`
  to compose the PR description.

## Step 4 — Record the decision

Non-trivial decisions (technology choice, architecture trade-off, algorithm
design, UX direction) get an ADR at `docs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md`:

```
# ADR-NNNN: [Title]
**Status**: Accepted  **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  **Linear**: [ISSUE-ID]

## Context
[Why did this decision come up?]

## Decision
[What we chose and the key reasons]

## Alternatives Rejected
[What we didn't choose and why]

## Consequences
[What this means for future work]
```

## Rationalization Table — Check Before Skipping Anything

| If you think... | The reality is... |
|---|---|
| "This task is too small for the commitment ritual" | The ritual takes 15 seconds. Skipping it is how discipline erodes. Emit the block. |
| "Skill is obvious, no need to announce it" | The announcement IS the commitment. Announcement → consistency pressure → compliance. |
| "TDD is impractical for frontend" | Snapshot tests, `/browse` screenshot diffs, visual regression count as TDD. Write the test first. |
| "I've already thought about alternatives" | If you didn't write them down, you didn't consider them. List ≥2 in RESEARCH.md. |
| "`/gsd-review` is excessive — just one model's plan is fine" | Different LLMs catch different blind spots. A plan that survives review from 2–3 independent reviewers is more robust. Run it. (cparx phases 04.9 → 05 silently dropped this for 8 phases — that's the failure mode ADR 0018 closes.) |
| "Two-stage review is excessive" | Stage 1 catches spec drift, Stage 2 catches code-quality drift. Different failures, different agents. |
| "Dev server isn't worth booting for this change" | If you touched JSX/TSX, boot it. 30 seconds. |
| "The user explicitly said ship fast" | Acknowledge urgency, explain risk in one sentence, offer minimum discipline that protects the critical path. |

## 14 Red Flags — STOP → DELETE → RESTART

1. Code written before the test (for TDD tasks)
2. Test added after implementation
3. Test passes on first run — no RED observed
4. Cannot explain why the test should have failed
5. Tests marked for "later" addition
6. "Just this once" reasoning
7. Manual testing claimed as verification evidence
8. Two-stage review collapsed into one
9. Framing discipline as "ritual" or "ceremony"
10. Keeping pre-written code as "reference" while writing tests
11. Sunk-cost reasoning about deleting unverified code
12. Describing discipline as "dogmatic"
13. "This case is different because..."
14. `/gsd-review` skipped — no `{phase}-REVIEWS.md` artifact

## Pressure-Test Scenarios — Self-Check

Before you skip any step, ask yourself:
- Would I skip this step if this code were running in production serving real users?
- Would a senior engineer reviewing this work accept the shortcut?
- Am I rationalizing? Check the rationalization table above.

If any answer gives you pause, follow the protocol.

## Verification Check (after phase completes)

Run this to prove the workflow actually fired:

```bash
# Commitment block present
grep -rn "## Workflow commitment" .planning/phases/{padded_phase}-*/ 2>/dev/null

# TDD tasks produced RED + GREEN commits
git log --oneline {phase_base}..HEAD | grep -cE "^[a-f0-9]+ (test|feat)\("

# Multi-AI plan review evidence (pre-execution)
test -f .planning/phases/{padded_phase}-*/{padded_phase}-REVIEWS.md \
  && wc -l .planning/phases/{padded_phase}-*/{padded_phase}-REVIEWS.md

# Two-stage review evidence (post-execution)
grep -l "Stage 2" .planning/phases/{padded_phase}-*/REVIEW.md

# Evidence per must_have in VERIFICATION.md
grep -c "^- \*\*Evidence" .planning/phases/{padded_phase}-*/VERIFICATION.md
```

If any check fails, the phase did NOT honor the enforcement plan. File this as
a process bug, update `docs/workflow/ENFORCEMENT-PLAN.md` to close the
loophole, and re-run the failed gate.

## Daily Quick Reference

1. Check GSD state — where did I leave off?
2. Check Linear — highest-priority unblocked issue?
3. Pull latest from base branch
4. Pick the task, emit the commitment ritual
5. Route to the right GSD entry point
6. Invoke the mapped Superpowers skills in order
7. Update decision log + GSD state at end of session

## Spec deltas (spec 0.9.0)

Per core spec §09, a host names every requirement it does not satisfy verbatim,
with rationale. Audited 2026-07-14 (ADR-0040).

- **§13 implicit GSD trigger — not wired.** `ts-declare-first` ships and its
  explicit trigger works; the §13 implicit trigger (GSD design phase detects a
  new TypeScript module in a TS-primary project) is not implemented. §13's
  Conformance section is SHOULD/MAY throughout, and this scaffolder is not
  itself a TypeScript project (no `package.json`), so `full` is preserved.
  Tracked for its own phase.
- **§14 prompt-injection — trivially conformant.** This scaffolder builds no
  LLM prompts from non-self-authored values, so §14's trigger condition cannot
  occur; §09 requires only that the host say so. The §14 generator for
  consuming projects is delegated to the `injection-guard` skill
  (agenticapps-observability 0.13.0, `implements_spec: 0.6.0`), gated by
  migration 0023's pre-flight.
- **§10 observability — delegated, not omitted.** Satisfied via the standalone
  `agenticapps-observability` skill (0.13.0, `implements_spec: 0.3.2`),
  consumed through its own install surface. A satisfied MUST per §09, not a
  delta; recorded here because the skill no longer ships from this repo
  (removed at 2.0.0, commit 217baec). Migration 0022 fails closed if absent.
- **§08 setup/update equivalence — satisfied via guarded snapshot, recorded for
  clarity.** §08 as amended at core 0.9.0 (upstream ADR-0018) makes the setup
  flow's *end state* normative, not the mechanism: setup MUST reach an end
  state equivalent to a full `0000`→latest replay, by either **replay** or
  **snapshot** (a prebuilt artifact assembled from the same migration sources,
  PROVIDED a drift guard runs in CI and fails the build when the artifact and
  the sources disagree). A host choosing snapshot MUST name its guard in its
  instruction file. This host uses snapshot: ADR-0036 replaced replay-on-setup
  because the chain contains prose and agent steps that cannot be
  shell-replayed. The named guard is **`migrations/check-snapshot-parity.sh`**,
  which runs in CI on every change and proves the snapshot and the
  `migrations/` sources agree — satisfying the amended §08's naming
  requirement. Before core 0.9.0 this was recorded as a genuine open delta:
  `spec/08-migration-format.md` carried `spec_version: 0.1.0` and said nothing
  about snapshots, so the letter of the pre-amendment text was unmet even
  though the guarantee it protects (one source of truth for the on-disk shape)
  was. Core 0.9.0 resolved it by making the guarded-snapshot strategy a named,
  conformant alternative to replay. A satisfied MUST per §09, not a delta;
  recorded here — like §10 above — because the mechanism differs from a naive
  reading of the section, and disclosure keeps the claim auditable.
- **§04 — a divergent copy ships alongside the canonical block.** §09 item 1 is
  satisfied: the canonical 13 are byte-identical here, at positions 1–13, in
  this file — the one carrying `implements_spec`. But the vendored workflow
  reference installed into every scaffolded project
  (`.claude/claude-md/workflow.md`, from `templates/`) carries its own 13-flag
  list under a reworded heading (`### 13 Red Flags — Trigger Automatic STOP →
  DELETE → RESTART`) with four flags reworded (1, 6, 12, 13 — e.g. `Any "just
  this once" reasoning` for canonical `"Just this once" reasoning`). That copy
  is what agents read at runtime. It is not a §09 item-1 violation — the spec
  binds the block to the host's instruction file, not to every downstream
  artifact — but it is unreconciled canonical prose and is disclosed rather
  than left silent. Reconciling it changes the payload of every scaffolded
  project and needs its own migration; tracked separately.

## Knowledge Capture — Ritual Tail (spec §15)

Transferable learnings must not die in a per-repo `session-handoff.md` that the
next session overwrites. This step routes them to a cross-repo memory: **one
Obsidian note per repo** in the operator's vault. It is the FINAL step of three
rituals — run it AFTER:

1. **Session handoff** — after `session-handoff.md` is written.
2. **Plan completion** — after the plan is marked complete in `.planning/`.
3. **Phase completion** — after the phase artifacts are committed.

The vault write is machine-local and MUST NEVER be committed to the repo, and
it MUST NEVER fail, block, or roll back the ritual that triggered it — on any
failure, print one warning line and continue.

Procedure:

1. Read `.planning/config.json` → `knowledge_capture`. **Skip** — print at most
   one info line (`knowledge-capture: skipped (<reason>)`) and continue the
   ritual — when the block is absent, `enabled` is `false`, or the parent
   folder of the `note` path does not exist (expand a leading `~` against
   `$HOME`). NEVER create the parent folder: an absent vault means "not this
   machine", not "set up the vault".
2. Distill **1–5 transferable learnings** from the ritual just completed. The
   bar: a learning qualifies only if it would change how you, another agent,
   or another host works next time — gotchas whose root cause generalizes,
   decision rationale with reusable trade-offs, tooling/workflow insights
   (what made the agent fast or slow), wrong assumptions and what corrected
   them. Status updates, restatements of the plan, repo facts already in
   ADRs/handoffs/CHANGELOGs, and filler do NOT qualify. **If nothing clears
   the bar, write nothing** — no empty log entries, no placeholders.
3. If the configured note does not exist, create it from this skeleton
   (canonical copy: `templates/obsidian-learnings-note.md` in the scaffolder;
   fill `<...>` and dates):

   ```markdown
   ---
   type: agentic-learnings
   repo: <repo-name>
   path: ~/Sourcecode/<org>/<repo-name>
   hosts: [claude]
   created: YYYY-MM-DD
   updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---

   # <repo-name> — Agentic Coding Learnings

   ## Key Learnings
   <!-- CURATED. Dedupe, merge, promote from the log, demote stale. ~10–20 items. -->

   ## Log
   <!-- APPEND-ONLY. Never edit or delete existing entries. Newest first. -->
   ```

4. Prepend a log entry at the TOP of `## Log` (the section is append-only:
   never edit or delete existing entries), heading exactly:
   `### YYYY-MM-DD — <handoff|plan|phase> — <short title> (claude)`,
   with the learnings as bullets.
5. Curate `## Key Learnings`: dedupe, merge related items, promote log entries
   that earned it, demote or remove stale ones. Target ~10–20 highest-value
   items — each a bolded short title plus one to three sentences carrying the
   transferable insight, not the status.
6. Update frontmatter: set `updated:` to today; ensure `claude` is listed in
   `hosts`.
7. Report to the user, in one or two lines, what was written (or why the step
   was skipped).

Vault safety (hard rules): touch ONLY the configured note — never other repos'
notes, the folder's `CLAUDE.md`, or anything else in the vault. Never write
secrets, tokens, URLs with embedded credentials, or client-confidential data —
redact before writing.
