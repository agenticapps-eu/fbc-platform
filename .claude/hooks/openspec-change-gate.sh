# openspec-change-gate — shim. Resolves the shared gate and hands over.
#
# shim-contract: 1.1.0
#
# The spec §18 change gate. This file is a SHIM, not an implementation: the
# enforcement surface is ONE host-agnostic script shared by every agent (claude,
# codex, opencode, pi) and by the git pre-commit + CI floor, so the rule lives in
# exactly one place and is tested in exactly one place. See spec §18,
# docs/WORKFLOW.md, and reference-implementations/project-hooks/README.md.
#
# Profile: published-resolution. Core's own .claude/hooks/openspec-change-gate.sh
# is the self-hosting profile and resolves its working-tree copy instead — see
# ADR-0028. Every hook has exactly one self-hosting binder.
#
# WHAT THE GATE BLOCKS ON — one thing.
#
#   `openspec validate --all` is not green.
#
# Reviewer count, verdicts, independence and the trailer are computed and
# REPORTED, never enforced (gate 2.0.0, openspec/specs/change-gate-enforcement).
# An earlier version of this header said the gate asks whether the change
# "carries REVIEWS.md with >= 2 independent reviewers" — it does not, and has
# not since 2.0.0. A blocked edit means a spec delta that does not parse, so fix
# the delta; it never means "go get a review".
#
# Resolution order — TWO candidates.
#   1. $OPENSPEC_GATE                              (explicit override)
#   2. ~/.agenticapps/bin/openspec-change-gate.sh  (the shared install)
#
# There is no third <repo>/bin/ candidate. A repo-local copy is the drift the
# shim exists to remove, and as a fallback it keeps the drift while hiding it on
# exactly the machines nobody checks.
#
# Fires on PreToolUse matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit
# Exit 2 = BLOCK; Exit 0 = ALLOW; Exit 1 = could not resolve — allow and report.
#
# Override (emergency, logged):  export GSD_SKIP_REVIEWS=1
# Stricter posture (opt-in):     export OPENSPEC_GATE_STRICT=1
#
# FAIL-OPEN AND REPORT if the gate cannot be located. A missing shared install
# must not brick every edit in a session.
#
# WHAT AN UNRESOLVABLE GATE ACTUALLY COSTS — stated correctly, because the
# previous header overstated the backstop. It said "the pre-commit + CI floor
# still catches the commit". On an UNPROVISIONED machine the pre-commit wrapper
# resolves the same absent shared install and fails open too, so **CI is the
# only floor left**. The pre-commit hook backstops a PROVISIONED machine.

# NO `export OPENSPEC_GATE_SELF` — and this is a deliberate removal, not an
# omission (tasks 4b.4, 4b.7).
#
# Every project's shim exported it, with a comment saying it named this host so
# its own reviews would not count toward the independence threshold. That
# comment stopped being true at gate 1.5.0: `OPENSPEC_GATE_SELF` is IGNORED,
# retained by the implementation "only so an operator who exported it is not
# misled by silence". The implementing host is read from the artifact's trailer,
# because CI and pre-commit evaluate evidence OTHER hosts produced and an
# environment identity names the wrong party.
#
# Task 4b.4 said to leave the line alone because the companion change
# `track-and-conform-plan-review` would also edit it and the two would conflict.
# That premise expired: the companion change was ARCHIVED on 2026-08-01, which
# is why 4b.7 asks for the residual to be re-checked rather than restated. It is
# checked, and it is discharged — so this change fixes THREE of the gate shim's
# three violations, not two.
#
# Setting a variable the implementation ignores, under a comment claiming it
# does something, is exactly the stale residue this change exists to remove.

# Candidate 1. An override that is set but unusable does NOT fall through — a
# silently ignored explicit instruction is worse than a loud one. Not rate
# limited: this is the kill switch, and for the §18 gate it is a one-variable
# bypass of enforcement at the tool boundary.
#
# REGULAR FILE, not merely `-x` — `-x` is true of any searchable directory, so
# this `exec`ed a directory and bash exited 126 before the report below could
# fire (shim-contract 1.1.0, Stage-2 finding 6). An override set to the empty
# string still falls through, deliberately; see the template's note.
