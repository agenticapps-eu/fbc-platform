# Hook 6 — Multi-AI Plan Review Gate (PreToolUse)
#
# Blocks code-touching Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations during a GSD phase
# if the phase has produced a *-PLAN.md but no *-REVIEWS.md (the multi-AI
# plan review, produced by `/gsd-review`).
#
# Rationale: ADR 0018. Plan reviews must run BEFORE execution begins.
# This hook detects the drift pattern observed in cparx phases 04.9 →
# 05 where /gsd-review was silently skipped.
#
# Fires on PreToolUse matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit
# Exit 2 = BLOCK; Exit 0 = ALLOW.
# Latency budget: sub-100ms on the common path (symlink + STATE.md awk parse).
# The gsd-tools (node) step is a fallback that fires only when neither resolves;
# it can add node cold-start latency, so STATE.md is tried before it.
#
# Override (emergency / non-phase work):
#   export GSD_SKIP_REVIEWS=1
# Or place a sentinel:
#   touch .planning/current-phase/multi-ai-review-skipped
#
# Source: ADR 0018 (gate), ADR 0025 (hybrid phase resolver), migrations 0005 + 0016.
