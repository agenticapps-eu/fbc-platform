# normalize-claude-md — shim. Resolves the fleet-shared implementation and hands over.
#
# shim-contract: 1.1.0
#
# This file is a SHIM, not an implementation. Editing it changes nothing about
# what the hook enforces; the implementation lives in agenticapps-workflow-core
# at reference-implementations/project-hooks/normalize-claude-md.sh and is published to
# ~/.agenticapps/bin/ by install-project-hooks.sh. See that directory's
# README.md for the contract this file implements.
#
# Profile: published-resolution (design Decision 17). It resolves a PUBLISHED
# copy, so the two-candidate resolution order and byte-identity across every
# project both bind it.
#
# The other profile is self-hosting: core's own
# .claude/hooks/openspec-change-gate.sh resolves its WORKING-TREE reference
# implementation instead, because ADR-0028 requires core to score the bytes it
# ships rather than whichever host's installer ran last. Resolution order and
# byte-identity cannot apply to it; the contract marker, the behaviour-free rule
# and fail-open-and-report still do.
#
# A hook has exactly ONE self-hosting binder. Two would be two authorities,
# which the project-hook-binding capability's first requirement forbids.

# --- resolution -------------------------------------------------------------
# Two candidates, in order. There is deliberately NO third <repo>/bin/ candidate:
# a repo-local copy is the drift this shim exists to remove, and as a fallback it
# would keep the drift while hiding it on exactly the machines nobody checks.

# --- reporting --------------------------------------------------------------
# Exit 1, never 2. Per the host's hook contract, an exit code other than 0 or 2
# is a non-blocking error: the transcript shows a "<hook> hook error" notice
# followed by THE FIRST LINE of stderr, and execution continues. Exit 2 would
# block, which is the one thing an unresolvable shim must not do — these hooks
# are registered on broad matchers, so blocking here blocks every command and
# every edit in the repository rather than the narrow thing the hook guards.
#
# The first line therefore has to carry the whole message. Everything after it
# reaches the debug log only.

report() { printf '%s\n' "$@" >&2; }

# The unresolvable-implementation condition is persistent: on an unprovisioned
# machine it holds on every Bash, Edit and Write, indefinitely. Reporting each
# time is the alarm fatigue this change rejects elsewhere, so it is rate limited
# to once per hour, per hook, per machine.
#
# ONCE PER HOUR, NOT ONCE PER SESSION, and the reason is recorded rather than
# the option dropped silently (task 2.11a): the session identifier exists only
# in the stdin payload — the host exports no session-id environment variable —
# and a shim that reads stdin to find it has consumed the implementation's
# input. An hour approximates a session closely enough to serve, while
# guaranteeing a long session sees the condition more than once.
#
# One marker path, read and written. No tool payload is inspected.

# --- candidate 1: the explicit override -------------------------------------
# An override that is set but unusable does NOT fall through to the shared
# install. Falling through would silently ignore an explicit instruction, and
# the operator who set it would never learn it had no effect.
#
# This report is deliberately NOT rate limited (task 2.11c). The override is a
# kill switch: it is the only signal that a hook has been switched off on an
# otherwise healthy machine, and a rate limit adopted to quiet the benign,
# self-correcting condition above must not also silence it.
#
# REGULAR FILE, not merely `-x`. `-x` on a directory tests the search bit, which
# every ordinary directory has, so `[ -x "$OVERRIDE" ]` alone called a directory
# executable and `exec`ed it — bash then exited 126 with its own "is a directory"
# message, the report below never fired, and the exit code was not the 1 this
# contract states (shim-contract 1.1.0, Stage-2 finding 6).
#
# An override set to the EMPTY STRING is treated as unset and falls through,
# deliberately: `FOO=` is the conventional way to say "no override", not a way to
# name a broken one, so "set" here means set to a non-empty value. Asserted in
# tools/project-hook-shim.test.sh so the reading is a decision, not an accident.
