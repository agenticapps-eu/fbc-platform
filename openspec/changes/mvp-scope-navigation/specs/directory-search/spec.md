## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Server-side directory search with facet filters

The system SHALL provide a `search_directory(...)` RPC that returns a fixed
column set per member (`id`, `name`, `avatar_url`, `region`, `company`,
`short_bio`, `branche`, `tier`, `roles`, `competencies`, `has_offers`,
`has_needs`, `offer_categories`, `need_categories`) with optional full-text
(`p_query`, German `search_doc` tsvector) and facet filters (`p_theme`,
`p_branche`, `p_region`, `p_competency`, `p_offering`, `p_offers`, `p_needs`).
The function SHALL be `SECURITY INVOKER`, so the caller's own RLS decides which
profile rows are returned, and SHALL list only `is_public` members.

`p_offers` and `p_needs` SHALL be `text[]` category filters matching
`offers.category` and `needs.category`. Within one array the categories SHALL be
combined with OR (a member matching any listed category qualifies); the two
arrays SHALL be combined with AND (a member must satisfy both groups when both
are supplied). A null or empty array SHALL mean "no filter" for that group.

`offer_categories` and `need_categories` SHALL carry the caller-visible, distinct,
non-null categories of that member's offers and needs, so the client can render
them without a second round trip. They SHALL NOT replace `has_offers`/`has_needs`:
a row whose `category` is null contributes to the boolean but not to the array, so
the two answer different questions.

Because two `text[]` parameters change the function's argument type list, the
migration SHALL **replace** the function — dropping the previous six-argument
signature explicitly and creating the new one — rather than relying on `create or
replace`, which would register an overload. It SHALL re-issue `revoke`/`grant`
against the new signature, keeping execute limited to `authenticated`.

The category arrays SHALL be built so that a member with no categorised rows
yields an **empty array, never null**: a filtered aggregate over rows whose
`category` is null evaluates to null in Postgres, which is a different value than
the empty array this contract promises and would force every client to handle two
shapes of "nothing".

Returning the categories widens what the directory discloses: it previously
revealed only _that_ a member offers or seeks something, and now reveals _what_ —
commercial intent such as "sucht Investoren". This is deliberate; it is the
feature. It SHALL NOT widen _who_ can see it. The disclosure stays behind exactly
the boundary that already governs the directory — `is_public` plus the base-table
rank gate — and no contact data is disclosed by it, so the platform's rule that
contact details are never released automatically is untouched.

#### Scenario: Full-text query matches the search document

- **WHEN** a caller invokes `search_directory` with `p_query` set
- **THEN** only members whose generated `search_doc` matches
  `websearch_to_tsquery('german', p_query)` are returned, subject to RLS

#### Scenario: Facet filters narrow the result

- **WHEN** a caller passes `p_branche`, `p_region`, `p_competency`, `p_theme`,
  or `p_offering`
- **THEN** results are restricted to members matching each supplied filter
  (a member "active in a theme" via any offer, need, or interest in that theme)

#### Scenario: Categories within one group are combined with OR

- **WHEN** a caller passes `p_offers => array['kapital','mentoring']`
- **THEN** members offering `kapital` **or** `mentoring` are returned

#### Scenario: The two groups are combined with AND

- **WHEN** a caller passes both `p_offers => array['kapital']` and
  `p_needs => array['experten']`
- **THEN** only members who offer `kapital` **and** seek `experten` are returned

#### Scenario: An empty or null category array does not filter

- **WHEN** a caller passes `p_offers => null` or `p_offers => array[]::text[]`
- **THEN** the offer-category filter is not applied and the other filters decide

#### Scenario: The result carries the member's categories

- **WHEN** a member has offers in `kapital` and `kontakte` and a need in `experten`
- **THEN** their row returns `offer_categories = {kapital,kontakte}` and
  `need_categories = {experten}`, each distinct and free of nulls

#### Scenario: A categoryless row still sets the boolean

- **WHEN** a member's only offer row has `category = null`
- **THEN** `has_offers` is true while `offer_categories` is the empty array — not
  null, which is what an unguarded filtered aggregate would return

#### Scenario: A member with no rows at all returns empty arrays

- **WHEN** a member holds neither offers nor needs
- **THEN** `offer_categories` and `need_categories` are both `{}` and neither is null

#### Scenario: Anonymous callers cannot execute the new signature

- **WHEN** an `anon` caller invokes the eight-argument `search_directory`
- **THEN** execution is denied, because the grant was re-issued to `authenticated`
  only and no privilege was inherited by the new signature

#### Scenario: A below-rank caller learns no other member's categories

- **WHEN** a caller below the directory's rank gate filters on `p_offers`
- **THEN** the base-table RLS still yields at most their own row, so neither the
  returned arrays nor the filtered result set reveals another member's categories

#### Scenario: The previous signature is gone, not shadowed

- **WHEN** the migration has run and a caller invokes `search_directory()` with no
  arguments
- **THEN** exactly one function resolves and the call succeeds (no
  "function is not unique" ambiguity from a leftover six-argument overload)

#### Scenario: Opted-out members are never listed

- **WHEN** a member has `is_public = false`
- **THEN** `search_directory` does not return them for any caller
